# HomelessConnect2U2
 
Connect2U was born out of a deep concern for those facing homelessness in San Francisco. Having lived in the city, I have witnessed the struggles of individuals on the verge of homelessness, as well as those who are already experiencing it. Whether due to substance use, job loss, mental illness, or reintegration after prison, homelessness is a complex issue that affects a wide range of people.
